* What is the price relation between room type and a suburb of the city?
* Is there a price difference between room type and bed type?
* Are the number of bathrooms or bedrooms important perks to influence the price?
* What are the top amenities offered?
* What months are cheaper to visit Seattle?
* What are the features or characteristics that influence in the price of a room?
